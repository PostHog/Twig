# @posthog/agent

The core runtime for PostHog cloud runs. Provides two things: an **Agent SDK** for running AI agents against PostHog tasks, and an **AgentServer** CLI that hosts the agent inside cloud sandboxes. Both are built on the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-client-protocol) for standardized agent ↔ client communication.

## Design decisions

### Why ACP?

ACP is a standard protocol for agent ↔ client communication over ndJson streams. Using it gives us two things:

1. **Any ACP-compatible client can connect** — the protocol is the contract, not our code.
2. **Clean separation** — the agent adapter knows nothing about HTTP, and the server knows nothing about Claude/Codex. They communicate through typed streams.

### Cloud vs local

The same ACP agent runs in both contexts. The difference is how it's connected:

**Cloud (AgentServer):** The agent runs inside a sandbox. `AgentServer` is an HTTP server (Hono) that wraps the ACP connection. Clients connect via `GET /events` (SSE) and `POST /command` (JSON-RPC). Authentication uses JWT tokens (RS256) — the sandbox holds a public key, PostHog Django holds the private key. In background mode, the server auto-starts, prompts the agent with the task description, and signals completion via the PostHog API. In interactive mode, it stays open for conversation.

**Local (Twig desktop):** The agent runs in-process. Twig calls `createAcpConnection()` directly — no HTTP server, no JWT. The bidirectional ACP streams connect client ↔ agent within the same process.

**TreeTracker** handles the bridge between these contexts: it captures the git working tree as snapshots (tree hash + file archive) so work can be transferred between cloud and local. This enables the "hand off" flow — start locally, continue in cloud, or vice versa. Tree snapshots use the Saga pattern (`src/sagas/`) for atomic operations with automatic rollback on failure.

### Permission modes

Four modes defined in `src/execution-mode.ts`:

| Mode               | ID                  | Behavior                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always ask          | `default`           | Prompts for permission on first use of each tool                |
| Accept edits        | `acceptEdits`       | Auto-approves file write tools for the session                  |
| Plan mode           | `plan`              | Read-only — the agent can analyze but not modify files          |
| Bypass permissions  | `bypassPermissions` | Auto-approves everything (hidden when running as root)          |

In cloud background mode, permissions are always auto-approved. In interactive mode, the permission system is active and configurable per session. Tool categorization lives in `src/adapters/claude/tools.ts` — each tool belongs to a group (read, write, bash, search, web, agent) and modes whitelist groups.

## ACP connection layer

`createAcpConnection()` in `src/adapters/acp-connection.ts` is the heart of the package. It's a factory that returns a `{ clientStreams, cleanup }` object — a pair of ndJson `ReadableStream`/`WritableStream` that the caller uses to speak ACP.

Internally it does three things:

1. **Creates bidirectional streams** — two pairs of `(readable, writable)` using `createBidirectionalStreams()`. One pair for the agent side, one for the client side, cross-wired so writes on one appear as reads on the other.

2. **Taps both directions for logging** — if a `logWriter` and `taskRunId` are provided, both the agent→client and client→agent writables are wrapped with `createTappedWritableStream`. Every ndJson line that flows through is appended to the `SessionLogWriter` buffer. This is transparent to both ends.

3. **Connects the adapter** — for Claude, it instantiates `ClaudeAcpAgent` and wires it to the agent-side streams via `AgentSideConnection`. For Codex, it spawns a subprocess and pipes the client-side streams to the process's stdin/stdout.

The Claude and Codex paths differ significantly:

**Claude (in-process):** The `AgentSideConnection` calls methods on `ClaudeAcpAgent` directly. The agent implements the full ACP `Agent` interface: `initialize`, `newSession`, `prompt`, `cancel`, etc. Under the hood, `prompt()` creates a Claude Agent SDK `Query` and processes messages in a loop, converting between ACP and SDK formats using the `src/adapters/claude/conversion/` module.

**Codex (subprocess):** There's no `AgentSideConnection` — the `codex-acp` binary speaks ACP natively on stdin/stdout. The connection layer adds `TransformStream` filters on both directions to: suppress noisy `session/update` messages during session loading, inject `_posthog/sdk_session` notifications, filter model lists to allowed IDs, and sync reasoning effort config before prompts.

## AgentServer

`AgentServer` (`src/server/agent-server.ts`) wraps an ACP connection in an HTTP server for cloud sandbox execution. It manages a single `ActiveSession` at a time.

### Session initialization flow

```text
start()
  │
  ├─ Hono HTTP server starts on configured port
  │
  └─ autoInitializeSession()
       │
       ├─ Creates synthetic JwtPayload from CLI config
       ├─ configureEnvironment() — sets ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, OPENAI_BASE_URL, etc.
       │    pointing at the PostHog LLM gateway
       ├─ Creates TreeTracker, SessionLogWriter, PostHogAPIClient
       ├─ createAcpConnection() — sets up ACP streams with log tapping
       │
       ├─ Wraps client streams with a SECOND tap layer (NdJsonTap)
       │    that broadcasts every ACP message to SSE clients
       │
       ├─ ClientSideConnection.initialize() — ACP handshake
       ├─ ClientSideConnection.newSession() — starts agent session
       │
       └─ sendInitialTaskMessage()
            ├─ Fetches task from PostHog API
            ├─ Sends task.description as first prompt
            └─ Background mode: signals completion/failure via API
               Interactive mode: stays open
```

The two tapping layers are distinct. The inner tap (from `createAcpConnection`) persists to logs. The outer tap (in `AgentServer`) broadcasts to SSE. This means log persistence works for both cloud and local, while SSE broadcast is cloud-only.

### HTTP endpoints

| Method | Path       | Auth | Description                                              |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/health`  | None | Returns `{ status: "ok", hasSession }`                   |
| `GET`  | `/events`  | JWT  | SSE stream — all ACP notifications broadcast in real time |
| `POST` | `/command` | JWT  | JSON-RPC commands: `user_message`, `cancel`, `close`     |

JWT validation (`src/server/jwt.ts`) uses RS256 with a configurable public key. The JWT payload carries `task_id`, `run_id`, `team_id`, `user_id`, `distinct_id`, and `mode`. The audience must be `posthog:sandbox_connection`.

### Commands flow through ACP

When `POST /command` receives a `user_message`, it doesn't handle it directly — it calls `clientConnection.prompt()` on the ACP `ClientSideConnection`, which sends a `session/prompt` message through the ACP streams to the agent. Similarly, `cancel` sends `session/cancel`. This means all commands follow the same path as in-process calls from Twig, with the HTTP layer just being a thin translation.

### Auto-approval in cloud mode

The `AgentServer` provides a `requestPermission` callback to the `ClientSideConnection` that always selects the "allow" option. In background mode this is necessary (no human to ask). In interactive mode it currently does the same, with a TODO for future per-tool approval via SSE round-trips.

### Tree state capture

After every `Write` or `Edit` tool call, the server captures a git tree snapshot via `TreeTracker` and broadcasts it as a `_posthog/tree_snapshot` SSE event. A final snapshot is captured during session cleanup. This is how the client knows what files changed and can restore state for cloud↔local handoff.

### CLI

```bash
npx agent-server \
  --port 3001 \
  --mode interactive \
  --repositoryPath /path/to/repo \
  --taskId task_123 \
  --runId run_456
```

Required environment variables (validated by zod in `src/server/bin.ts`):

- `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` — RS256 public key for sandbox auth
- `POSTHOG_API_URL` — PostHog API base URL
- `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` — API key for PostHog requests
- `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID` — numeric project ID

## Agent SDK

The `Agent` class (`src/agent.ts`) is the entrypoint for local/programmatic usage. It handles LLM gateway configuration, log writer setup, and model filtering — then delegates to `createAcpConnection()`.

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@posthog/agent/agent"

const agent = new Agent({
  posthog: {
    apiUrl: "https://app.posthog.com",
    getApiKey: () => process.env.POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY!,
    projectId: 12345,
  },
})

// Run a task — returns an ACP connection with bidirectional streams
const connection = await agent.run(taskId, runId, {
  repositoryPath: "/path/to/repo",
  adapter: "claude", // or "codex"
})

// Attach a PR to the task run output
await agent.attachPullRequestToTask(taskId, prUrl)

// Cleanup: flush logs and release resources
await agent.cleanup()
```

Key difference from `AgentServer`: the SDK returns raw ACP streams for the caller to manage. There's no HTTP layer, no SSE broadcasting, and no auto-prompting. The caller is responsible for creating a `ClientSideConnection`, running the ACP handshake, and sending prompts. This is what Twig does when running agents locally.

For Codex adapters, `agent.run()` also fetches available models from the PostHog gateway and filters to OpenAI-compatible models, passing the allowed set to the ACP connection for model list filtering.

## Log pipeline and session resume

Logs serve two purposes: real-time observability and session resume. Every ACP message that flows through the tapped streams is persisted, creating a complete record of the conversation — user messages, agent responses, tool calls, tool results, tree snapshots, and metadata events. This record is the single source of truth for resuming a session from any point.

### Writing logs

`SessionLogWriter` (`src/session-log-writer.ts`) is a per-session multiplexer that buffers raw ndJson lines. On flush (auto-scheduled 500ms after writes, or explicit), it dispatches to whichever backend is configured:

- **OTEL** (`src/otel-log-writer.ts`) — preferred path. Creates an OpenTelemetry `LoggerProvider` per session with resource attributes (`task_id`, `run_id`, `device_type`) set once and indexed via `resource_fingerprint`. Each ndJson line is emitted as an OTEL log record with an `event_type` attribute (the ACP method name) and exported via OTLP HTTP to PostHog's `/i/v1/agent-logs` endpoint. Batch flush interval defaults to 500ms.
- **Legacy S3** — falls back to `PostHogAPIClient.appendTaskRunLog()`, which POSTs batched `StoredNotification` entries to the Django API. The API stores them as the task run's `log_url`.

Both backends can be active simultaneously — OTEL for fast indexed queries, S3 for full log download.

### Resuming from logs

When a session needs to continue (e.g. cloud↔local handoff, or recovering from a crash), `resumeFromLog()` in `src/resume.ts` reconstructs the agent's state from the persisted log. This is implemented as a `ResumeSaga` (`src/sagas/resume-saga.ts`) with the following steps:

```text
1. fetch_task_run   → GET /api/.../runs/{runId}/ to find the log_url
2. fetch_logs       → Download all StoredNotification entries
3. find_snapshot    → Scan backwards for latest _posthog/tree_snapshot
4. apply_snapshot   → Download archive from snapshot URL, restore working tree
5. rebuild_conversation → Walk log entries to reconstruct conversation turns
6. find_device      → Scan backwards for last device info (local vs cloud)
```

The conversation rebuild (`rebuildConversation`) walks the log entries and reassembles turns from ACP `session/update` notifications:

- `user_message` / `user_message_chunk` → start a new user turn
- `agent_message_chunk` → accumulate into the current assistant turn (merging consecutive text blocks)
- `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` → track tool calls with their inputs
- `tool_result` → match results back to tool calls by `toolCallId`

The result is a `ResumeState` containing the conversation history as `ConversationTurn[]`, the latest tree snapshot, and metadata. This feeds into the ACP `session/load` or `_posthog/session/resume` methods on the Claude adapter, which initializes a new Claude SDK query with the rebuilt context.

Snapshot application can fail without aborting the resume — if the archive URL is missing or the download fails, the saga logs a warning and continues with just the conversation history. The `snapshotApplied` flag in the result tells the caller whether files were actually restored.

## ACP extensions

ACP defines standard methods like `session/prompt`, `session/update`, and `session/cancel`. PostHog extends the protocol with custom notifications in the `_posthog/` namespace (`src/acp-extensions.ts`). These serve three purposes:

**Session lifecycle** — events that track the run from start to finish. Clients use these to update UI state (show progress, enable/disable controls, display completion). The Django API uses `task_complete` to mark the run as finished.

- `_posthog/run_started` — `{ sessionId, runId, taskId? }` — session initialized and ready
- `_posthog/task_complete` — `{ sessionId, taskId }` — agent finished (success or end-turn)
- `_posthog/error` — `{ sessionId, message, error? }` — unrecoverable error
- `_posthog/status` — `{ sessionId, status, message? }` — progress updates
- `_posthog/sdk_session` — `{ taskRunId, sessionId, adapter }` — maps the ACP session to a task run and adapter type (emitted once per session, used by clients to know which adapter is active)

**State synchronization** — events that keep the client's view of the agent's state in sync. These are essential for the cloud↔local handoff flow and for the client to render accurate UI.

- `_posthog/branch_created` — `{ branch }` — agent created a git branch (client can update branch display)
- `_posthog/tree_snapshot` — `{ treeHash, baseCommit, changes, ... }` — git working tree captured as a snapshot. Contains the tree hash, base commit, file change list, and optionally an archive URL. This is the key event for session resume — the resume saga scans backwards for the latest snapshot to restore files
- `_posthog/mode_change` — `{ mode, previous_mode }` — permission mode changed (client updates mode selector)
- `_posthog/compact_boundary` — `{ sessionId, timestamp }` — marks where context compaction occurred, so the client knows the conversation was summarized at this point
- `_posthog/task_notification` — `{ sessionId, type, message?, data? }` — generic extensible notification for adapter-specific events

**Client→agent commands** — notifications that flow from client to agent (via `POST /command` in cloud, or direct ACP in local). These are the "verbs" the client can send outside of `session/prompt`.

- `_posthog/user_message` — `{ content }` — user typed a message (translated to `session/prompt`)
- `_posthog/cancel` — cancel the current operation (translated to `session/cancel`)
- `_posthog/close` — close the session and clean up
- `_posthog/session/resume` — `{ sessionId, fromSnapshot? }` — request to resume a previous session (triggers the resume flow on the Claude adapter)

**Debug** — operational visibility without polluting the ACP conversation.

- `_posthog/console` — `{ sessionId, level, message }` — structured debug/info/warn/error log from the agent internals
